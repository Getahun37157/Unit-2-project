                <h2>Self-driving Vehicles</h2>
                <p>Autonomous vehicles, also known as self-driving vehicles, are vehicles that can drive themselves without human intervention. They use a combination of hardware and software to sense the environment and make decisions about how to drive. </p>

                <p>The main goal of autonomous vehicles is to improve safety by reducing human error. Some potential benefits of autonomous vehicles include: Reduced traffic congestion, Lower transportation costs, Improved walkability and livability, and Reduced urban CO2 emissions. </p>
                <p>Some companies that are developing autonomous vehicles include Google (now Waymo) and General Motors. However, there are currently only a few thousand autonomous vehicles on US roads, and most of them are being used to test their capabilities. </p>
